To download a webpage as a PDF using WebtoPDF, you can follow these steps:

1. Visit [WebtoPDF](https://webtopdf.com).
2. Enter the URL of the webpage you want to convert into the URL input box, which in this case is `https://resume.kanakjr.in/`.
3. Click the `Options` button to set page layout, conversion settings, rights management, and watermark according to your preferences.
- **Page Size:** Select `A2 (420 x 594 mm, 16.5 x 23.4 in)` from the dropdown menu. This is a standard paper size, larger than the common A4.
  
- **Margins:** Set the margins to `2 mm` for both top and bottom margins. Margins define the space between the text and the edge of the paper. A setting of `2 mm` indicates a very narrow margin, which means the content will stretch closer to the edges of the page.
  
- **Zoom:** Set this to `110%`. Zoom affects the scaling of the webpage on the PDF. At `110%`, the content will be enlarged to be 10% bigger than its original size on the webpage.

- These settings should provide a PDF that closely resembles the webpage with slightly enlarged content and narrow top and bottom margins on an A2-sized page. If these are not the desired settings, you would adjust each accordingly before proceeding with the conversion.

4. Click the `Convert` button to start the conversion process.
5. Once the conversion is complete, you can preview the file.
6. If everything looks good, proceed to download the file to your device.
